# Placeholder file

This file exists to ensure the `models/` folder is tracked by Git.
Do not delete it unless you add other files here.

# Purpose:
- Trained models (e.g., `migraine_demographics_model.joblib`) will be saved here after running `main.py`.
- Models are **gitignored** to avoid pushing large/binary files to GitHub.
